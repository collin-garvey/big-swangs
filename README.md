FFXIV ACT theme for DPS parser overlay

This is a small *legacy* side project in which I created a custom skin for a damage meter for the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. 

The damage meter detects when a player is in combat and tracks their damage (and party members' damage) against enemies such as raid bosses. This functionality is provided by Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT). My theme sits on top of this program and renders its output with customized styling into a small window that is overlayed on screen while playing the game.

It looks something like this:
